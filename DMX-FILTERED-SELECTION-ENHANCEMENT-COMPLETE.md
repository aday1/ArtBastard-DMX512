# DMX Channel Filtering Enhancement - Active Fixtures & Groups

## Feature Summary
Enhanced the TouchDmxControlPanel with advanced filtering options to display only channels from:
- **Active Fixtures**: Fixtures with non-zero DMX values 
- **Specific Groups**: All channels belonging to a selected fixture group

## Implementation Details

### New Filter Types Added

1. **Active Fixtures Only**
   - Shows channels from fixtures that have at least one non-zero DMX value
   - Dynamically updates as DMX values change
   - Reduces clutter by hiding inactive fixtures

2. **Group Filters**
   - One filter option per fixture group
   - Shows all channels from fixtures within the selected group
   - Dynamically updates when groups are created/modified

### Technical Implementation

#### Enhanced Interface
```typescript
interface ChannelFilter {
  name: string;
  startChannel: number;
  endChannel: number;
  isSelectedOnly?: boolean;    // Existing: Selected channels only
  isActiveFixtures?: boolean;  // NEW: Active fixtures only
  groupId?: string;           // NEW: Specific group ID
}
```

#### Helper Functions Added

1. **`getActiveFixtureChannels()`**
   - Identifies fixtures with non-zero DMX values
   - Returns sorted array of all channels from active fixtures
   - Eliminates duplicates automatically

2. **`getGroupChannels(groupId)`**
   - Maps group fixture indices to actual fixtures
   - Collects all channels from fixtures in the group
   - Handles missing fixtures gracefully

3. **`getDynamicChannelFilters()`**
   - Builds filter list dynamically based on available groups
   - Inserts group filters between "Active Fixtures" and "All Channels"
   - Updates automatically when groups change

#### Filtering Logic Enhancement

The channel display logic now handles three filter types:

1. **Selected Only** (`isSelectedOnly: true`)
   - Uses existing `selectedChannels` array
   - Pagination based on selected channel count

2. **Active Fixtures** (`isActiveFixtures: true`)
   - Uses `getActiveFixtureChannels()` helper
   - Shows channels from fixtures with activity

3. **Group Specific** (`groupId: string`)
   - Uses `getGroupChannels(groupId)` helper  
   - Shows all channels from group fixtures

4. **Range Based** (default)
   - Uses existing start/end channel range logic
   - Traditional channel range filtering

### User Interface

#### Filter Dropdown Options
- Selected Channels Only
- **Active Fixtures Only** ⭐ NEW
- **Group: [Group Name]** ⭐ NEW (one per group)
- All Channels  
- Channels 1-16
- Channels 17-32
- etc.

#### Benefits for Users

1. **Efficient Touch Control**
   - Focus on currently active lighting
   - Quick access to specific fixture groups
   - Reduced scrolling through unused channels

2. **Professional Workflow**
   - Group-based lighting control
   - Activity-based channel management
   - Context-sensitive channel display

3. **Dynamic Adaptation**
   - Filters update as groups are created/modified
   - Active fixture detection updates in real-time
   - Seamless integration with existing features

## Integration Points

### Store Dependencies
- `fixtures`: Fixture definitions and configurations
- `groups`: Fixture group definitions  
- `dmxChannels`: Current DMX channel values
- `selectedChannels`: User-selected channels

### Compatibility
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Works with existing touch optimizations
- ✅ Integrates with current pagination system
- ✅ Supports all existing filter types

## Files Modified

- `TouchDmxControlPanel.tsx`
  - Enhanced interface definitions
  - Added helper functions for filtering
  - Updated filtering logic
  - Dynamic filter generation

## Usage Examples

### Active Fixtures Workflow
1. Set up your lighting scene
2. Select "Active Fixtures Only" filter
3. Control only the fixtures currently in use
4. Perfect for live performance adjustments

### Group-Based Control
1. Create fixture groups (e.g., "Stage Wash", "Moving Heads")
2. Select "Group: Stage Wash" from filter dropdown
3. Control all fixtures in that group simultaneously
4. Ideal for organized lighting design

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional filter types:
- **Fixtures by Type** (Moving Head, LED Par, etc.)
- **Fixtures by Manufacturer**
- **Recently Modified Channels**
- **MIDI-Mapped Channels**
- **OSC-Assigned Channels**
