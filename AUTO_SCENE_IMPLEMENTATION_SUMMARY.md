# Auto Scene Management Features - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Completed Successfully

### âœ… Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed Critical Ping-Pong Mode Bug**
   - **Issue**: Infinite bouncing between last and second-to-last scenes
   - **Solution**: Corrected boundary condition logic in `setNextAutoSceneIndex` function
   - **Result**: Proper ping-pong pattern: `test â†’ test2 â†’ test3 â†’ test2 â†’ test â†’ test2 â†’ test3 â†’ ...`

### âœ… New Features Added

#### 1. Auto Scene Management UI in Scene Gallery
- **Auto Scene Management Card**: Dedicated section for managing auto-play functionality
- **Bulk Controls**: 
  - "Add All" button to include all scenes in auto-play list
  - "Clear All" button to remove all scenes from auto-play list
- **Auto-Play Queue Display**: Shows current scenes in auto-play list with removal capability
- **Smart Status Messages**: Context-aware messages based on theme and current state

#### 2. Enhanced Scene Cards

- **Visual Styling**: 
  - Special border and gradient background for scenes in auto-play list
  - Animated pulse effect on auto-play badges
  - Themed color schemes matching the application's design

#### 3. Complete Integration
- **Store Integration**: Full auto-scene state management integration
- **Component Communication**: Seamless integration between SceneGallery and AutoSceneControl
- **Persistent State**: Auto-scene settings are saved to localStorage
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Scene Gallery immediately affect Auto Scene Control

### âœ… Testing Verified
1. **Ping-Pong Logic**: Tested and confirmed proper bouncing pattern
2. **Random Mode**: Verified no consecutive duplicates
3. **Edge Cases**: Tested single scene scenarios
4. **Integration**: Confirmed SceneGallery â†” AutoSceneControl communication
5. **UI Functionality**: All buttons and controls work as expected

### ðŸŽ‰ Result
Users now have a complete auto-scene management system that allows them to:
- Easily select scenes for automated playback from the Scene Gallery
- Use bulk operations for efficient scene list management
