### üé¨ AutoScene Control Fixes
#### Issues Fixed

**1. BPM Manual Text Entry Field Missing**
- **Problem**: The AutoSceneControlMini component was missing the manual BPM input field when "Manual BPM" tempo source was selected
- **Solution**: 
  - Added conditional rendering of number input field when `autoSceneTempoSource === 'manual_bpm'`
  - Added corresponding CSS styling for `.bpmInput` class
  - Connected the input to the `setManualBpm` store action

**2. Missing Internal Clock Option**
- **Problem**: AutoSceneControlMini only showed "Manual BPM" and "Tap Tempo" options, missing the "Internal Clock" option
- **Solution**: Added "Internal Clock" option to the tempo source dropdown select element

**3. Scene Triggering Not Working from Main Page**
- **Problem**: The AutoSceneControlMini component wasn't implementing the local clock management and scene triggering logic
- **Solutions Implemented**:

**a. Added Local State Management**
- `localBeatCounter`: Tracks beats for scene timing
- `isLocalClockPlaying`: Manages play/pause state for manual/tap tempo modes
- `prevBeatRef`: Reference for internal clock beat tracking
- `intervalRef`: Timer reference for manual/tap tempo intervals

**b. Added Store Dependencies**
- `midiClockIsPlaying`: For internal clock mode
- `midiClockCurrentBeat`: For internal clock beat tracking
- `setNextAutoSceneIndex`: For scene progression
- `loadScene`: For actually loading scenes
- `triggerAutoSceneFlash`: For visual feedback

**c. Implemented Clock Management Effects**
- **Independent Clock Effect**: Manages timer intervals for manual_bpm and tap_tempo modes
- **Master Clock Tracking Effect**: Syncs with master clock beats for internal_clock mode
- **Scene Change Trigger Effect**: Detects when to advance to next scene based on beat division
- **Scene Loading Effect**: Actually loads the current scene when conditions are met

**d. Enhanced Button Behavior**
- Modified START/STOP button to properly handle play/pause states for different tempo sources
- Added automatic clock starting when enabling AutoScene
- Improved status indicator to show actual playing state

**e. Visual Feedback Improvements**
- Updated status icon to reflect actual playing state (not just enabled state)
- Maintained compatibility with shared flashing state for beat visualization

#### Technical Details
**Key Files Modified**
- `AutoSceneControlMini.tsx`: Main component logic
- `AutoSceneControlMini.module.scss`: Added `.bpmInput` styling

**State Flow**
1. **Enable AutoScene** ‚Üí Button sets `autoSceneEnabled = true` and starts appropriate clock
2. **Clock Ticking** ‚Üí Increments `localBeatCounter` based on tempo source
3. **Beat Division Reached** ‚Üí Triggers `setNextAutoSceneIndex()` and `loadScene()`
4. **Scene Loading** ‚Üí Updates DMX channels with scene data
5. **Visual Feedback** ‚Üí Flash effect and status updates

**Tempo Source Behaviors**
- **Internal Clock**: Syncs with master MIDI clock, uses `requestToggleMasterClockPlayPause()`
- **Manual BPM**: Uses local interval timer with user-specified BPM
- **Tap Tempo**: Uses local interval timer with calculated BPM from taps

#### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ BPM Manual input field appears when selected
- ‚úÖ Internal Clock option is available in dropdown
