## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Interfaces
```typescript
interface AdvancedFixtureControls {
  // Original controls
  dimmer, shutter, strobe, colorWheel, goboWheel, goboRotation,
  zoom, focus, prism, iris, speed, macro, effect,
  // NEW: Professional controls
  frost, animation, animationSpeed, cto, ctb, reset,
  lampControl, fanControl, display, function
}
```

### Channel Mapping
The system automatically detects and maps these channel types from fixture definitions, supporting both standard and alternative naming conventions.

### DMX Integration
All controls directly update DMX channels with proper validation and error handling.

## Result

The Chromatic Energy Manipulator now serves as the **comprehensive fixture control interface** with:

- **20+ Control Types** - From basic RGB to professional effects
- **35+ Channel Types Supported** - Including fine control channels
- **Multiple Control Modes** - Basic, Advanced, and Performance
- **Professional Features** - CTO/CTB, Animation, Frost, Lamp Control
- **Enhanced UI** - Organized into logical control sections
- **Complete Fixture Management** - Selection, flagging, and bulk operations

The old Fixture Controller components have been completely removed and replaced with this single, more powerful control interface that provides even more functionality and professional lighting control capabilities.
