# MIDI Learn Slider Movement Fix

## Problem
When clicking "MIDI Learn" on a DMX channel and then sending MIDI data, the DMX channel value was being updated in the backend but the slider UI was not moving visually.

## Root Cause
The `MidiDmxProcessor.tsx` component had incomplete implementation for processing MIDI messages and updating DMX channels. The code contained placeholder comments like:
```typescript
// ... (rest of the existing DMX channel processing logic: scaling, setDmxChannel, event dispatch) ...
```
But the actual implementation was missing.

## Solution
Fixed the `MidiDmxProcessor.tsx` component by:

1. **Completed MIDI CC Processing**: Added full implementation for MIDI Control Change messages
2. **Added MIDI Note Processing**: Implemented proper handling for MIDI Note On/Off messages
3. **Added Range Mapping Support**: Included support for custom input/output ranges and curve adjustments
4. **Added Inversion Support**: Added support for inverting MIDI input values
5. **Added Event Dispatching**: Added custom DOM events to notify UI components of DMX updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended MidiRangeMapping Interface
```typescript
interface MidiRangeMapping {
  inputMin?: number;
  inputMax?: number;
  outputMin?: number;
  outputMax?: number;
  curve?: number;
  inverted?: boolean; // NEW: Add support for inverted MIDI input
}
```

### 2. Complete MIDI CC Processing
```typescript
if (mapping.controller !== undefined &&
    mapping.channel === latestMessage.channel &&
    mapping.controller === latestMessage.controller) {
    // Complete scaling and value conversion logic
    // Custom event dispatching for UI updates
}
```

### 3. Complete MIDI Note Processing
```typescript
if (mapping.note !== undefined &&
    mapping.channel === latestMessage.channel &&
    mapping.note === latestMessage.note) {
    // Handle Note On/Off with velocity
    // Complete scaling and value conversion logic
    // Custom event dispatching for UI updates
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```powershell
   .\start-dev.ps1
   ```

2. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Test MIDI Learn**:
   - Click "MIDI Learn" on any DMX channel
   - Send a MIDI Control Change or Note message from your MIDI controller
   - The slider should now move visually to reflect the MIDI input value

4. **Check Console**: You should see detailed logging:
   ```
   [MidiDmxProcessor] Found DMX channel mapping for CC X on CH Y -> DMX CH Z
   [MidiDmxProcessor] MIDI CC X value Y -> DMX CH Z value W
   ```

## Additional Features

The fix also adds support for:
- **Custom Range Mapping**: Map MIDI 0-127 to custom DMX ranges
- **Input Inversion**: Invert MIDI input (127 becomes 0, etc.)
- **Response Curves**: Apply exponential or logarithmic curves to MIDI response
- **Note Velocity**: Use MIDI note velocity for DMX value control

## Files Modified
- `react-app/src/components/midi/MidiDmxProcessor.tsx`
- Compiled to: `react-app/dist-tsc/components/midi/MidiDmxProcessor.js`

The fix ensures that when MIDI Learn creates a mapping between a MIDI control and a DMX channel, moving the MIDI control will visually update the corresponding DMX channel slider in real-time.
