# ⚡ **Features Overview** - ArtBastard V5.12

> *"Features without purpose are merely digital decorations. Every capability serves the art. We have eliminated the frivolous, the unnecessary, the 'user-friendly' nonsense that plagues amateur software. What remains is pure, uncompromising power for those who understand that lighting is not a craft, but an art form. We honor the legacy of the Wind Dancing Masters, who first understood that light could be choreographed. Their ancient wisdom flows through every feature, every control, every photon we command."*  
> — *Le Créateur des Lumières*

*"If you find yourself overwhelmed by these features, perhaps you should first master the basics of theatrical lighting before attempting to use a tool designed for professionals. We recommend starting with a simple dimmer and working your way up. ArtBastard is not a training wheel - it is a Formula One race car. Drive it accordingly. The Wind Dancing Masters did not achieve mastery overnight, and neither shall you."*

## 🎯 **Core Control Systems** *(The Foundation of Photonic Mastery)*

### **DMX512 Universe Management** *(Because One Universe Is Never Enough)*
- **Multi-universe support** - Expand beyond 512 channels, because true artists are not limited by the constraints of mere mortals. If 512 channels suffice for your needs, perhaps you are not creating art, but merely "turning on lights."
- **Art-Net integration** - Network-based DMX distribution for professional installations. If you're still using USB cables, *mon ami*, it is time to evolve. The future is networked, and it is *magnifique*.
- **Real-time monitoring** - Live channel value display that updates with the immediacy your artistry demands. Watch your commands take effect in real-time, as they should.
- **Address conflict detection** - Prevent fixture overlaps before they become problems. We've eliminated the tedious manual checking that plagued lesser systems, because your time is too valuable for such pedestrian concerns.

### **Professional Fixture Control** *(For Fixtures That Deserve Respect)*
- **Pan/Tilt positioning** with speed curves so smooth, they would make a Swiss watchmaker weep. Control every degree of movement with the precision your artistry demands.
- **Color mixing** (RGB, RGBW, CMY) that produces hues so pure, they would make Monet question his palette choices. We've eliminated the muddy, imprecise color mixing that plagues amateur systems.
- **GOBO & pattern selection** worthy of a museum. Choose from professional gobo libraries, or import your own custom patterns. Because true artists do not limit themselves to the patterns provided by manufacturers.
- **Beam control** (zoom, focus, iris, prism) with precision that would make a neurosurgeon envious. Every parameter is yours to command.
- **Animation effects** with speed control that allows you to create sequences worthy of a professional installation. We've eliminated the jerky, amateurish animations that plague lesser software.
- **Color temperature correction** (CTO/CTB) for those who understand that color is not merely RGB values, but a complex interaction of temperature, saturation, and artistic intent.
- **Face Tracking Integration** - Revolutionary real-time face tracking that maps human movement to pan/tilt control. Nod your head, shake it side to side - watch as your fixtures follow your every gesture. Transform your movements into photonic choreography. *C'est révolutionnaire!*

*The clip launcher transforms scene management from a simple list into a powerful live performance instrument. Launch scenes with the precision and speed of a professional lighting operator. Because live performance requires more than just scene buttons - it requires a performance instrument.*

## 🎛️ **Advanced Automation & Control**

### **Modular Automation System** *(Because True Artists Control Every Aspect)*
- **🎨 Color Automation** - Rainbow, color cycling, pulsing colors with precision that would make Monet weep. Speed range: 0.1x-1.0x for precise control.
- **💡 Dimmer Automation** - Breathing, strobing, ramping intensity with the grace of a ballerina
- **🔄 Pan/Tilt Automation** - Movement patterns (circle, figure8, linear sweeps) worthy of a professional installation. Automatic tempo synchronization with pause when tempo stops.
- **✨ Effects Automation** - GOBO cycling, prism rotation, focus sweeps that transform mere illumination into visual poetry
- **⏱️ Tempo Synchronization** - Autopilot and auto color automatically pause when tempo stops if synced to BPM. True artists respect the rhythm.

*Unlike primitive "autopilot" systems, ArtBastard's modular automation allows you to control each aspect independently. Want colors to cycle but pan/tilt to stay still? *Bien sûr!* Want dimmer to breathe but effects to remain static? *Évidemment!* True artistry requires this level of control.*

### **Scene Integration with Automation**
- **Automatic State Preservation** - All automation states are saved and restored with scenes
- **Independent Module Control** - Each automation module (color, dimmer, pan/tilt, effects) can be enabled/disabled independently
- **Scene-Specific Automation** - Different scenes can have different automation configurations
- **Seamless Transitions** - Automation states transition smoothly when loading scenes

*Because true artists understand that lighting is not about individual fixtures, but about compositions. Your scenes deserve to remember their automation states, and ArtBastard ensures they do.*

## 🎹 **MIDI & OSC Integration** *(For Those Who Command Light, Not Merely Operate It)*

### **Comprehensive MIDI Control**
- **MIDI Learn System** - Map any MIDI CC or Note to any control with the ease that even a novice could manage (though we doubt they would appreciate the artistry)
