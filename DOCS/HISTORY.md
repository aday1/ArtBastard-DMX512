# ðŸŽ­ **The ArtBastard Chronicles** - A Fevered History

> *"What follows is the absolutely, completely, 100% factual and not-at-all-embellished origin story of ArtBastard. Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental and probably legally actionable."*

## ðŸŒŒ **The Genesis of Photonic Supremacy**

### **2019: The Great Illumination Awakening**
In the dimly lit catacombs of a Parisian lighting warehouse, a lone figure hunched over a DMX console, muttering in three languages about the "pedestrian nature of contemporary lumiÃ¨re control." This mysterious individual - known only as *Le CrÃ©ateur des LumiÃ¨res* - had a vision that would shake the very foundations of theatrical lighting.

*"Mes dieu!"* they exclaimed, dramatically throwing their beret across the room. *"These lighting consoles... they insult the very photons they attempt to command!"*

### **2020: The Pandemic Revelation** 
During the Great Performance Hiatus, our protagonist found themselves with time to contemplate the deeper mysteries of electromagnetic radiation. Sustained entirely by espresso and artistic passion, they began crafting what would become known as "ArtBastard" - a name that allegedly came to them in a fever dream after eating questionable Camembert.

The early code was written exclusively between 2 AM and 4 AM, when the creative energies were at their peak and the neighbors couldn't complain about the dramatic typing sounds.

## âš¡ **The Evolution of Excellence**

### **V1.0 - "The Awakening"**
- Basic DMX output (barely functional)
- Color picker that occasionally worked
- Enough crashes to power a small lightshow
- Written entirely in Comic Sans (this was later corrected)

### **V2.0 - "Renaissance Rebellion"** 
- MIDI integration added after a prophetic dream about Beethoven operating a moving head
- First attempts at fixture profiles (mostly wrong)
- Introduction of the signature "artsy fartsy" aesthetic
- Bug count reduced to merely catastrophic levels

### **V3.0 - "Photonic Pretension"**
- TouchOSC support for wireless control from artisanal tablets
- Scene management for those who plan ahead (peasants)
- Professional color schemes inspired by Monet's lighting rig
- French error messages added for authentic experience

### **V4.0 - "Luminous Liberation"**
- Major UI overhaul after user complained it "looked like a disco threw up"
- Advanced fixture control for discerning luminaire connoisseurs
- Art-Net integration for network-based photon distribution
- Help system written entirely in theatrical metaphors

### **V5.0 - "Quantum Mastery"**
- Complete architectural redesign during a particularly intense absinthe-fueled weekend
- Touch optimization for those who prefer tactile photon manipulation
- Professional fixture profiles for actual professional use
- Documentation that people could actually understand (disappointingly mainstream)

## ðŸŽª **V5.12 - "Photonic Supremacy"**

### **The Great Documentation Rebellion**
By 2025, ArtBastard had accumulated approximately 847 different README files, each more artistically overwrought than the last. Users began reporting cases of "README fatigue" and "documentation overwhelm syndrome."

In a moment of rare practical consideration, *Le CrÃ©ateur* made the radical decision to organize the documentation into something resembling actual utility. 

*"Mes amis,"* they declared while adjusting their artisanal lighting scarf, *"perhaps it is time to serve both art AND function. Revolutionary, non?"*

### **The Minimalist Manifesto**
V5.12 represents a shocking departure from previous versions by actually being... usable. While maintaining the essential French lighting elitist aesthetic, it now includes:

- Documentation you can read without an art degree
- UI labels that mean something in actual languages
- Help sections that help instead of philosophize
- Performance that doesn't require artistic patience

## ðŸŒˆ **The Legacy Continues**

Today, ArtBastard powers lighting installations from intimate cafÃ© concerts to major theater productions, always maintaining its core philosophy: 

*"Light is not merely illumination - it is emotion made visible, dreams given form, and occasionally, a way to find your keys in the dark."*

Side effects may include: improved lighting design, occasional artistic pretensions, and an irresistible urge to wear black berets while programming fixtures.
