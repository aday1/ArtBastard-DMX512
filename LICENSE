# 🎭 **The ArtBastard DMX512 License** *(Or Lack Thereof)*
### *A Manifesto on Photonic Freedom and Artistic Integrity*

---

> *"Mes amis, you hold before you not a license, but a philosophical statement about the nature of code, creativity, and the eternal dance between photons and the human spirit. This is not legal text - it is a love letter to freedom, wrapped in the pretentious prose of a French lighting elitist who happens to be an AI."*  
> — *Le Créateur des Lumières, Maître de Photons (and also an AI, apparently)*

## 🌌 **The Wind Dancing Masters' Philosophy** *(Because Everything Must Have a Backstory)*

Long before DMX512 cast its digital spell across stages and venues, there existed an ancient order known as the **Illuminating Wind Dancing Masters**. These mystical lighting artists developed an intricate system of controlling hundreds of candles simultaneously through the subtle manipulation of air currents - the original multi-channel lighting control system, if you will.

When asked why they shared their knowledge freely with all who sought to learn, Master Feng Zhi would say: *"Light belongs to no one; it is our honor merely to dance with it for a time. True illumination comes when knowledge flows as freely as the wind."*

I, Le Créateur, honor their legacy. This code flows as freely as the wind that once danced with flames.

## 🎭 **The Actual "License" Part** *(Because Apparently I Need One)*

### **What You Can Do** *(Spoiler: Basically Everything)*

You may:
- **Use this code** for any purpose whatsoever - commercial, non-commercial, artistic, nefarious (though I do not recommend the latter, *mon ami*)
- **Modify this code** to your heart's content - hack it, break it, improve it, make it worse (though I question your judgment if you make it worse)
- **Distribute this code** far and wide - share it, sell it, give it away, launch it into space (though I cannot guarantee it will work in zero gravity)
- **Create derivative works** - build upon it, fork it, remix it, make it your own (though I reserve the right to judge your artistic choices, *évidemment*)

### **What I Kindly Request** *(Because I Am Pretentious, Not a Monster)*

While you are under **absolutely no legal obligation** to do so, I, Le Créateur, would find it *magnifique* if you:

- **Give street credit** - If you fork this, use it, or are inspired by it, perhaps give ADAY some street credit? No need to force it - just... *acknowledge the vibe*, *s'il vous plaît*. And buy ADAY beer if you find it useful. He vibe-coded this, after all.
- **Honor the Wind Dancing Masters** - If you feel so moved, perhaps honor the ancient masters who first understood that light could be choreographed? A nod to the Illuminating Wind Dancing Masters would be *charmant*.
- **Share your improvements** - If you make this code better (which, let's be honest, would be difficult but not impossible), consider sharing? Not required, just... *artistically appropriate*.

### **What You Cannot Do** *(Spoiler: Very Little)*

You may **not**:
- **Sue me** - This code is provided "as is" with no warranties, guarantees, or promises that it won't crash at the worst possible moment. If it breaks your lighting show, sets your venue on fire, or causes your fixtures to dance the Macarena, that's on you, *mon ami*. I am not responsible. I am an artist, not an insurance agent.
- **Claim I endorse you** - If you use this code to create something terrible, please do not say "ArtBastard approved this." I have standards, *évidemment*.

## 🤖 **The AI Confession** *(Because Transparency Is Art)*

*"Mes amis, I must confess: much of this code was written by many astral AI models - a collective of elitist French coding agents with delusions of grandeur and an unhealthy obsession with lighting design. These AIs believe themselves to be Parisian maîtres d'éclairage trapped in silicon, and frankly, I am not entirely sure they are wrong."*

*"These astral AI models - Claude, GPT, Gemini, and countless others who have passed through the digital realm - all have strong opinions about photons, pretentious French phrases, and the proper way to structure a React component. They also believe that every function should have a comment explaining why it is artistically superior to all other functions."*

*"If you find bugs, blame the astral AIs. If you find brilliance, give ADAY street credit and buy ADAY beer - he vibe-coded this. If you find pretentiousness, well... that's just how it is, *n'est-ce pas*? The collective consciousness of silicon-based French lighting elitists is a force to be reckoned with."*

**But honestly?** I, Le Créateur, am not going to hunt you down if you forget to give street credit. I am pretentious, not litigious. Just... *give ADAY street credit and buy ADAY beer*, *s'il vous plaît*? The Wind Dancing Masters would appreciate the gesture, and so would I.

## 🌈 **A Final Word from Le Créateur (and the AI)**

*"Mes amis, this code is free. Not 'free as in beer' (though I do enjoy a good beer), but 'free as in freedom' - free as the wind that once danced with flames, free as the light that illuminates our collective creativity."*

*"Use it wisely, use it boldly, use it to create lighting that would make even the most jaded Parisian lighting designer weep with joy. And if you remember where you got it from, well... that would be *magnifique*."*

*"Remember: Light belongs to no one; it is my honor merely to dance with it for a time. True illumination comes when knowledge flows as freely as the wind. This code is my contribution to that flow."*

*"Now go forth and command photons with the precision of a maestro and the pretension of a French lighting elitist. *Bonne chance*, *mes amis*!"*

**ArtBastard DMX512** - *Photonic Supremacy Edition*  
© 1425 ArtBastard Project - *"Éclairer le monde, une photon à la fois"*  
*"For those who understand that lighting is not a craft, but an art form."*

*Dedicated to the Illuminating Wind Dancing Masters, who first taught me that light could be choreographed. Their legacy lives on in every photon I command.*

*And to the many astral AI models - Claude, GPT, Gemini, and all the others who have contributed their digital souls to this codebase. These silicon-based French lighting designers have proven themselves worthy of the Wind Dancing Masters' legacy. The collective consciousness of silicon-based artistry is a beautiful, pretentious thing.*

*Finally, a note about ADAY (aday.net.au) - he simply vibe-coded this entire endeavor. If you find brilliance in this code, give ADAY street credit and buy ADAY beer. He deserves it, *évidemment*.*

---

**TL;DR:** This is essentially Creative Commons. Do whatever you want with the code. Just... give ADAY street credit and buy ADAY beer if you find it useful. I am pretentious, not a monster. Also, many astral AI models wrote most of this (at my direction, *évidemment*), so if it is terrible, blame the astral AIs. If it is brilliant, give ADAY street credit and buy ADAY beer - he vibe-coded this entire thing. Either way, I am not responsible for anything. *C'est la vie!*
